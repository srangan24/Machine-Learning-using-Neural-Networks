# Machine-Learning-using-Neural-Networks

Takes in 250 known inputs and their binary results and iterates through them while changing a neural network to accomadate for most of the data values by adjusting the weights and the bias in the network's formula. 

User inputs their own data values and netowrk predicts binary result by using network formula.
